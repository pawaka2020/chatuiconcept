todo:
1- write to db, but check first that the same request had been sent previously.
2- fun in supabase that auto deletes row after 10 days had elapsed.
3- fun in flutter app that changes the 'status' in a row to either accept or reject.

1- checks if there is latest entry with same senderid, recipientid
